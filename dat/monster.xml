         Believed to have been created as expendable foot soldiers by some unknown race in the distant past, these dull-witted creatures have since spread to every corner of the known galaxy. Orks come in a variety of shapes and sizes, but the common variety is about 1 to 1.5 meters tall with gray or greenish skin, and heavy bone structures with protruding ridges around vulnerable areas. Aggressive and prodigious breeders, if left unchecked orks will overrun their environment and fall to fighting amongst themselves.

         Small rodent-like canines, wild varch can be found in less-reputable spaceports everywhere. Although a lone varch is not usually a threat varch packs have been known to kill unwary travelers.
